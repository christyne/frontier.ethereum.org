The Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization registered in Switzerland, and has the purpose of managing the funds that were raised from the Ether Sale in order to best serve the Ethereum and decentralized technology ecosystem.

To that end, aside from its expenditures supporting Ethereum development, the Ethereum Foundation is also participating in a number of industry collaboration efforts.




## Organization Structure

![Foundation Structure](/images/company-structure.svg "Foundation Structure")


### W3C Payments group


Ethereum is participating in the [W3C Payments Group](http://www.w3.org/blog/wpig/2015/02/19/web-payments-ig-meeting-in-utrecht-getting-my-feet-wet-and-moving/) with a view to making sure that the ongoing standardization work keeps open space in the specs for current and future work on non-repudiatable payments, cryptocurrencies and even smart contracts. The W3C Payments Group is a moderately large, diverse working group with a variety of interests from the technology, finance and fintech sectors, with a strong interest in user privacy and security. 

These are primary goals of the group because there are the areas where the web's current payment solutions are weakest: large scale credit card fraud is a major driver here. We anticipate further involvement in the group will be fruitful and productive. We are still learning how the W3C standards process works, it's a complex organization with lots of history, but we hope to be able to make sure that future specs in this area are supportive of our needs and the needs of other players in the cryptocurrency and cyberfinance space.


### Legal collaboration

The Ethereum Foundation is participating in and contributing, both financially and with the active involvement of our members, to a number of efforts involved in legal and regulatory outreach for the benefit of the cryptocurrency space. We proudly support the [Coin Center](https://coincenter.org/), a non-profit organization based in Washington dedicated to researching the legal implications of cryptocurrency and engaging in policy advocacy efforts, as well as other efforts that will soon be revealed.

## Founders 

### Vitalik Buterin

Vitalik first discovered Bitcoin in 2011, and the combination of math, economics and an immediate feeling that it represented the way that money "should be" attracted him immediately to the scene. In September 2011 he became the cofounder and original head writer for Bitcoin Magazine. Following this, Vitalik founded Ethereum, a blockchain-based arbitrary-state Turing-complete scripting platform useful for smart contracts, computational resource marketplaces, financial experimentation, decentralized governance and many other use cases that we have not even thought of.

### Jeffrey Wilcke

Jeffrey is one of the original Ethereum co-Founders and has been working on the development of the Ethereum project since December 2013. He's the lead developer on the Go Ethereum implementation, director of ETH DEV and currently occupied with the development of the Mist browser. Currently he's working from an office in the city center of Amsterdam where he works, together with a band of likeminded individuals, on Ethereum's technology. Occasionally he likes to make an attempt to escape the world of Ethereum and works on one of his many indie game titles.

### Gavin Wood

Gavin has worked on various projects, including implementing a C++-based video analysis DSL, tools to analyse english-law contracts, the first semantically-rich lighting control deck, and the first C++ language workbench. These days he busies himself as the co-founder and effective CTO of the Ethereum project, coordinating and guiding the development process and helping flesh out the final protocol.


### Taylor Gerring

Taylor Gerring is a strategic technology entrepreneur with visions for a data-driven future. Formally an integration expert at major media companies Clear Channel Radio and Tribune Company, his current focus is on cryptographic consensus and peer-to-peer systems. After briefly working in and writing about the Bitcoin industry, Taylor joined Ethereum to help architect a new frontier of distributed coordination. Anticipating the potential of these new decentralized systems to impact the physical world, Taylor founded Chicago Futurists, a forum to discuss emergent technologies and their impact on communities.


### Anthony Di Iorio

Anthony is a co-founder of the Ethereum project and currently serves on the leadership / management team. He oversees Ethereum operations in Canada and works out of Decentral, a business development centre in Toronto that's home to tech start-ups and entrepreneurs that focus on disruptive and decentralized technologies. Since 2012 Anthony has spoken at dozens of global Bitcoin and related events and has been heavily involved in building the community in Canada. Anthony is a founding member of the Global Bitcoin Alliance and Bitcoin Alliance of Canada where he served as the first Executive Director. He also founded the bitcoin wallets Kryptokit and Rushwallet, the recently launched video dashboard decentral.tv, and daily talk show Decentral Talk Live.

### Stephan Tual

Passionate about the potential of blockchains since 2010, Stephan founded Ursium three years later conscious that while the excitement around decentralization is at an all time high, many questions remain unanswered. In January 2014, Stephan joined the Ethereum project as CCO. His current focus is on the intersection of blockchain technology and embedded hardware, where autonomous agents can transact as part of an optimal Internet of Things economy. His work’s focal point is on the potential for societal change engendered by users regaining control over both their funds and personal information within decentralized networks.

### Mihai Alisie

Mihai Alisie is co-founder of the Ethereum Project and currently serves as the Vice President of the Ethereum Foundation. With a background in cybernetics, economy informatics and statistics, Mihai has entered the crypto space in 2011 when together with Vitalik Buterin founded the world’s first crypto focused publication: Bitcoin Magazine. In late 2013 he was invited to be part of the Ethereum leadership team and was responsible for establishing the Swiss Ethereum HQ and the Foundation, which implied also overseeing the creation of the legal strategy and business infrastructure at project level.

### Joseph Lubin

After studying EE and CS at Princeton, Joseph has had various posts in tech and finance. He managed the Robotics Lab at Princeton and worked at Vision Applications, Inc., on autonomous mobile robotics, machine vision and neural networks and later developed an autonomous music composition tool at Tomandandy Music. Software engineering, finance and cryptography were central during employment with Goldman Sachs, the Identrus project, and the co-founding and operation of a hedge fund. Two years into a music industry project in Jamaica, Joseph co-founded the Ethereum Project, and currently serves in leadership on the Ethereum Foundation. Joseph is also developing Consensus Systems (ConsenSys), a firm that focuses on building decentralized applications.
